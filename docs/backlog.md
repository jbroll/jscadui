## Deploy

jscad.rkroll.com runs `dev` with the AI chat folded in (2026-09-17): the
frontend is jscad-web hybrid plus the studio API on :3006, the compute frame
on jscad-run.rkroll.com. 2026-09-18: deployed from `main` with local-first
rowboat storage (versioned projects, per-project chat persistence, table sync
on sign-in via `/api/sync-token`), then the project UI batch (side drawer
with stacked tabs, project list/switch/rename, append-only version restore,
local/rowboat toggle, drop branching). Smoke: site 200, `/api/health` 200,
`/api/sync-token` 401 anonymous, relay 403 on fake origin. The old `main` export breakage (worker requesting
`bundle.jscad_io` with no `/build/` prefix) is fixed on this branch by
requiring the registered `@jscad/io` alias instead. Merged to `main`
2026-09-20 as `feat/fluent-worker-bundle`: fluent worker bundle in both
apps plus four backlog fixes (WASM clone ownership, build clean, alias
cache, export identity).
